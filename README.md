# Advent Of Code 2025 - Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **Advent of Code 2025**, implemented in **Java** with a clean, test-driven approach.<br />
Each day includes:
- **Solution code (Java)**
- **Unit tests**
- **Tests using the real Advent of Code input**

All personal puzzle inputs are **intentionally excluded**, as recommended by the Advent of Code team.

## Requirements
- **JDK 25**
- **Gradle** (wrapper included)

## Using your own Advent of Code inputs

Puzzle input files are not included in this repository.
To run the real-input tests on your machine:
1.	Download your personal AoC dataset (from the website).
2.	Place it in the appropriate file (e.g., src/test/resources/dayXX/inputData.txt).
3.	Update the expected result inside DayNNResolverTest.
